# AngazaProject
This is my customer segmentation project for a town in rural Africa.
As a board member of Code2Connect, we worked with a team of studentd based in Africa to mentor them through weekly lessons on machine learning and data science concepts, creating digital artifacts such as videos and articles. My main aim through this project was to not only priortize on expanding my knowledge of Data Science but educate undergraduates in unserved communities as well.  It was essential to me to enhance inclusivity, independant thinking and visibility within this communtiy. The final assignment for each student was to use their acquired knowledge to build their own research papers, a process we helped guide them through. I attached a few of the lessons that we taught as well as the final project(Labeled Final). Through this experience, I realized the profound potential of data science not only as a tool for analysis but also as a means of fostering positive change in underserved communities.
